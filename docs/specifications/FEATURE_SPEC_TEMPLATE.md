## 11. Implementation Requirements for Codex

### 11.1 Two-Tier Logging System
Codex must maintain both high-level status and detailed implementation logs:

#### Tier 1: High-Level Dashboard Updates
Update `docs/specifications/workflow-log.md` with:
- **Branch name** when implementation begins
- **PR link** when pull request is created  
- **Status changes** (In Progress → Review → Complete)
- **Key milestones** and completion dates
- **Performance/validation summary** (pass/fail, metrics)

#### Tier 2: Detailed Task Log
Create comprehensive log at `archive/codex_task_logs/feat_spec-[component-name]-tasks.md` using the [template](../../archive/codex_task_logs/TASK_LOG_TEMPLATE.md):
- **Granular task breakdown** with completion status
- **Implementation decisions** and challenges encountered
- **Code files created/modified** with descriptions
- **Testing details** and validation results
- **Performance metrics** and cost analysis
- **Lessons learned** and recommendations

### 11.2 Logging Requirements
1. **Start Implementation**: Update workflow dashboard to "In Progress" status
2. **During Implementation**: Maintain detailed task log in real-time
3. **Create PR**: Update dashboard with PR link and status change
4. **Completion**: Update both logs with final results and metrics

### 11.3 Implementation Deliverables
Upon completion, Codex should provide:
- [ ] Complete component implementation with tests
- [ ] Updated high-level workflow dashboard
- [ ] Comprehensive detailed task log
- [ ] Ready-to-merge pull request
- [ ] Performance validation against Episode 7
