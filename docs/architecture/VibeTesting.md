## Vibe Testing Protocol
*How to validate that the intended vibe is being achieved.*

### **Testing Questions**
1. When starting production: "Do I feel excited about what will be generated?"
2. During processing: "Do I trust the system is working correctly?"
3. After completion: "Am I eager to share this with my audience?"
4. After failure: "Do I understand what went wrong and how to fix it?"

### **Success Metrics**
- **Time to Confidence**: How quickly users trust the system won't break
- **Surprise Frequency**: How often generative content exceeds expectations
- **Recovery Speed**: How quickly users can resolve issues and continue
- **Sharing Eagerness**: How excited users are to publish generated content
