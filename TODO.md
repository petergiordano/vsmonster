  - [x] Install Python 3.11, FFmpeg 7.1, required dependencies  
  - [x] Configure .env file template (needs API key)  
  - [x] Add Episode 7 test file to project structure  
  - [x] Run validation scripts - 100% success rate  

- [x] Step 5: Foundation Interview ✅ 2025-01-07  
  - [x] Use /start-coding command in Claude Code CLI  
  - [x] Complete foundation interview with AVPS-specific tech stack  
  - [x] Generate populated AI_CONTEXT.md with AVPS knowledge  
  - [x] Create comprehensive foundation documents (Roadmap, VibeTesting, ComponentLibrary, SLC_Session_Notes)
  - [x] Document critical Pipeline Tag Specification for service integration  

- [ ] Step 6: PRD Development  
  - [ ] AVPS Claude Project prepares PRD prompt using PRD-v0 as foundation  
  - [ ] Claude Code CLI generates comprehensive AVPS PRD  
  - [ ] Validate PRD includes 8-component strategy and Episode 7 validation  
  - [ ] Save as tasks/prd-avps-pipeline.md  

- [ ] Step 7: Component Task Generation  
  - [ ] Generate detailed task breakdown for 8 components  
  - [ ] Start with Component 1 (Script Parser) as first implementation  
  - [ ] Each task includes Episode 7 validation requirements  
  - [ ] Save as tasks/tasks-avps-pipeline.md  

- [ ] Step 8: Begin Development  
  - [ ] Use template's task execution process  
  - [ ] Implement Component 1 with Claude Code CLI  
  - [ ] Validate with Episode 7 before proceeding  
  - [ ] Accumulate learnings in AI_CONTEXT.md  
  - [ ] Continue iteratively through all 8 components
