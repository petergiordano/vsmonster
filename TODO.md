# Session TODO: AI-Assisted Development Template Enhancement

## Tasks for This Session (REVISED ORDER)

## üéâ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Template Inheritance + Context Engineering Complete!

### ‚úÖ TEMPLATE INHERITANCE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED!
- **Template Repository Workflow** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Scaffolding Preservation** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- **Template Remote Configuration** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Update Documentation** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**üöÄ TEMPLATE INHERITANCE ACHIEVED:**
- Projects created from template can inherit updates via `git pull template main`
- Scaffolding files (.ai-rules/, .project-docs/, .claude/) properly preserved
- Setup command copies scaffolding contents instead of deleting them
- Template remote automatically configured for seamless updates
- GitHub template repository workflow with inheritance capability
- Documentation updated for "Use this template" + template updates workflow

**üìù COMMITTED TO GITHUB:** All enhancements successfully committed and pushed

### ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX: Claude Command Accessibility - **COMPLETED**
- **Problem Discovered:** `.claude/` commands in scaffolding created chicken-and-egg problem
- **Root Cause:** Users need `/project-setup` to access commands, but commands weren't available until after setup
- **Solution Implemented:** Moved `.claude/` from `_project-scaffolding/.claude/` to root level
- **Files Updated:**
  - **Moved:** `_project-scaffolding/.claude/` ‚Üí `.claude/` (now immediately available)
  - **Updated:** `.claude/commands/project-setup.md` (removed `.claude/` copy operation)
  - **Updated:** `README.md` (corrected documentation about file copying)
- **Result:** Users now have immediate access to `/project-setup` command upon template creation
- **Follow-up Fix:** Updated `/orient` command to recommend `/start-coding` (main orchestrator) instead of individual step commands
- **Testing Confirmed:** Template inheritance system fully functional ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ 5. Evaluate CLI Assistant Role Documentation - **COMPLETED**
**Goal:** Determine optimal CLI Assistant context delivery method
- [x] Assessed current CLI briefing approach (enhanced AI_CONTEXT.md)
- [x] Applied context engineering principles - determined simple reference approach optimal
- [x] Created CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md for automatic context loading
- [x] Enhanced AI_CONTEXT.md with CLI-specific section (Section 11)
- [x] Updated all documentation to reference CLI context integration
- [x] Ensured context handoff efficiency between Chat AI and CLI AI roles
  

## Current Template Status
- ‚úÖ Core workflow (5 steps) complete
- ‚úÖ Plan Mode integration complete  
- ‚úÖ All AI rule files created
- ‚úÖ Project context templates ready
- ‚úÖ User onboarding and workspace setup complete
- ‚úÖ Chat AI (Claude Project) integration complete
- ‚úÖ CLI AI context integration complete
- üéÜ **TEMPLATE COMPLETE AND READY FOR PRODUCTION USE!**

## Session Deliverables
1. Updated README.md and WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md with workspace instructions
2. Clear post-setup action sequence
3. Complete Claude project for Chat Assistant role
4. CLI Assistant role documentation (if needed)
5. Context engineering enhancement recommendations

## Notes
- Keep user's preference for numbered next steps in mind
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing template structure
- Focus on reducing friction for new users
