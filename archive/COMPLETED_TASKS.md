## Historical Notes

### Meeting Notes
- **2025-01-07:** Environment setup completed with conda consideration
  - Conda approach documented but proceeding with venv for now
  - FFmpeg PATH issue resolved (Homebrew location)
  - All packages successfully installed and validated

### Key Decisions
- Used venv instead of conda for simplicity
- Adopted "Function Over Fashion" philosophy
- Episode 7 as primary validation case
- 8-component iterative build strategy
