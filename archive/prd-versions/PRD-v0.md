# **versusMonster Video Pipeline \- PRD v1.0 (ITERATIVE BUILD)**

## **PRODUCT OVERVIEW**

### **Core Vision**

**Automated Video Podcast Production System**: A Python-based automation system that transforms markdown scripts (generated by your Claude project) into complete multimedia podcast episodes suitable for YouTube. The system eliminates the manual, time-intensive work of audio/video production so you can focus purely on creative content.

### **Business Goal**

Generate **2 podcast episodes per week for a full year (104 episodes)** to build an audience and explore monetization through advertising and sponsorships.

### **Development Philosophy**

**Function Over Fashion**: Build iteratively in simple steps where each step compounds the benefit from the previous one. No fancy UI/UX at the beginning \- purely command-line tools that deliver functional value immediately.

## **ITERATIVE BUILD STRATEGY**

### **Step 1: Script Parser** 

**Goal**: Parse markdown → structured JSON **Input**: Episode 7 markdown script **Output**: JSON timeline with voice lines extracted **Value**: Foundation for all automation **Validation**: Can extract all Thorak/Zara dialogue correctly

### **Step 2: Voice Generation**

**Goal**: JSON → individual voice files **Input**: JSON timeline from Step 1 **Output**: Separate WAV files for each character line **Value**: Proves ElevenLabs integration works **Validation**: Thorak and Zara sound authentic and distinct

### **Step 3: Audio Assembly** 

**Goal**: Voice files → complete audio track **Input**: Individual voice files \+ timing data **Output**: Single MP3 with proper dialogue timing **Value**: First complete "podcast episode" (audio-only) **Validation**: 2-3 minute audio sounds professionally timed

### **Step 4: Static Video** 

**Goal**: Audio \+ single image → video file **Input**: Audio track \+ one background image **Output**: MP4 video file with static background **Value**: First YouTube-uploadable content **Validation**: Professional-looking video ready for upload

### **Step 5: Image Transitions** 

**Goal**: Multiple images → dynamic video **Input**: Audio track \+ 8 episode images **Output**: Video with image changes at section breaks **Value**: Visual storytelling that keeps viewers engaged **Validation**: Images change at logical story points

### **Step 6: Sound Effects** 

**Goal**: Add SFX layer to existing video **Input**: Video \+ SFX cues from script **Output**: Enhanced video with battle sounds, dice rolling, etc. **Value**: Professional podcast production quality **Validation**: SFX perfectly timed to dialogue and action

### **Step 7: Background Music** 

**Goal**: Add music layer to complete the audio mix **Input**: Enhanced video \+ music cues **Output**: Full production video with complete audio **Value**: Broadcast-ready content for audience growth **Validation**: Music enhances without overwhelming dialogue

### **Step 8: Batch Processing** 

**Goal**: Process multiple episodes automatically **Input**: Multiple script files **Output**: Queue of complete videos **Value**: True automation for 2 episodes/week goal **Validation**: Can generate week's content with single command

### **Command-Line Interface (No UI)**

\# Step 1: Parse script

python parser.py episode\_007.md

\# Step 2: Generate voices

python voice\_gen.py episode\_007.json

\# Step 3: Mix audio

python audio\_mix.py episode\_007

\# Step 4: Create video

python video\_gen.py episode\_007

\# Eventually: One command does everything

python batch.py episode\_007.md

## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **1\. Each Step Must Work Independently**

* Step 2 doesn't break if Step 3 isn't built yet  
* Can test and validate each component in isolation  
* Easy debugging when something goes wrong

### **2\. Compound Value Building**

* Step 1 → useful JSON structure  
* Step 2 → playable character voices  
* Step 3 → complete podcast audio  
* Step 4 → uploadable YouTube video  
* Each step adds value to previous work

### **3\. Simple Configuration**

* Single config.json for API keys and settings  
* No databases, complex UIs, or fancy frameworks  
* Pure Python scripts that can be run from terminal

### **4\. Immediate Validation**

* Each step produces output you can test manually  
* Clear success/failure at every stage  
* Easy to verify quality before moving to next step

## **PHASE DEFINITIONS**

### **Phase 1: Audio Foundation**

**Deliverable**: Complete podcast audio file from script **Components**: Parser \+ Voice Generation \+ Audio Assembly **Success Metric**: Can listen to full episode with proper character voices

### **Phase 2: Video Creation** 

**Deliverable**: YouTube-ready video with visual storytelling **Components**: Static Video \+ Image Transitions **Success Metric**: 15-20 minute video ready for upload

### **Phase 3: Production Polish** 

**Deliverable**: Professional-quality multimedia experience **Components**: Sound Effects \+ Background Music **Success Metric**: Broadcast-quality content indistinguishable from manual production

### **Phase 4: Automation Scale** 

**Deliverable**: Batch processing for sustainable production **Components**: Queue management \+ error handling **Success Metric**: Generate 2 episodes per week with single command

## **VALIDATION STRATEGY**

### **Each Step Must Pass These Tests:**

1. **Functional**: Does it produce the expected output?  
2. **Quality**: Is the output usable for the next step?  
3. **Reliable**: Does it work consistently with different inputs?  
4. **Simple**: Can you run it with a single command?

### **No Step Ships Until:**

* It works with Episode 7 content  
* Output quality meets minimum standards  
* Next step can successfully use its output  
* Error handling is clear and actionable

---

**Bottom Line**: Build the simplest possible version of each component first. Each step should deliver immediate, testable value that compounds with previous work. No fancy interfaces \- just rock-solid functionality that gets you closer to automated episode production with every iteration.
