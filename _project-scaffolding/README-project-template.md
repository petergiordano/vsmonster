# [Your Project Name]

**[Brief one-sentence description of what your project does]**

## 🚀 Quick Start - Setup Required

**Welcome to your new project!** Complete setup in 30 seconds:

### **Essential Setup (One-Time)**

Open terminal in VS Code and run:

```bash
# Start Claude Code CLI
claude

# Set up your project workspace (one-time only)
/setup-project
```

**What this does:**
- Cleans up template files → creates your project structure
- Sets up AI-assisted development workflow
- Creates foundation documents for your project

### **After Setup - Start Building**

```bash
# Begin feature development 
/start-coding
```

---

## 🎯 Your Development Journey

```
1. 🔄 /setup-project (complete workspace setup) ← START HERE
2. 🔄 /start-coding (foundation → PRD → tasks → implementation)
3. 🔄 /start-coding (next feature: PRD → tasks → implementation)
4. 🧭 /orient (navigation and state checking)
```

---

## Development Workflow (After Setup)

This project uses the AI-Assisted Development Framework for efficient feature development.

### **Commands You'll Use:**

```bash
# Check current project state and get guidance
/orient

# Develop new features (foundation → PRD → tasks → implementation)
/start-coding
```

### **3-Party Collaboration:**
- **You:** Project director making decisions and testing results
- **Chat AI:** Strategic planning and requirements definition
- **CLI AI:** Technical implementation and file operations

- [Prerequisite 2 - e.g., Python 3.11+]

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [project-directory]

# Install dependencies
[installation commands - will be defined during setup]
```

### Usage

```bash
# Basic usage example
[command to run your project - will be defined during development]
```

## Project Structure (After Setup)

After running `/setup-project`, your workspace becomes:

```

## Development

### **AI-Assisted Development**

This project uses a structured AI collaboration workflow:

- **Chat AI (Strategy):** Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini for planning and context
- **CLI AI (Implementation):** Claude Code/Gemini CLI for technical execution
- **Progressive Validation:** 4-level quality gates ensure reliable code

### **Adding New Features**

```bash
# Start feature development workflow
/start-coding

# The system will guide you through:
# 1. Feature definition (PRD creation)
# 2. Task breakdown (implementation planning)
# 3. Code execution (with validation)
```

### **Project State Management**

```bash
# Check where you are and what's next
/orient

# Examples of what you might see:
# "Foundation complete → Ready for first feature"
# "PRD exists → Generate task list"
# "Tasks ready → Begin implementation"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
[test commands - will be defined during development]
```

### Building

```bash
[build commands - will be defined during development]
```

## AI Development Context

Your project's AI context is maintained in `AI_CONTEXT.md` and includes:
- Project goals and technical approach
- Coding conventions and architecture patterns
- Dependencies and constraints
- Testing requirements

This context automatically loads when using Claude Code or Gemini CLI.

## Contributing

[How others can contribute to your project]

### For Contributors Using AI Assistance

1. **Read the project context:** Check `AI_CONTEXT.md` and `.project-docs/`
2. **Use the workflow:** Follow the `/start-coding` process for new features
3. **Maintain quality:** Leverage the built-in validation systems
