# AI-Assisted Project Template

### **Purpose: A streamlined workflow for developing with AI assistance.**

This repository is a template for starting new software projects using a structured, AI-assisted workflow. It provides a simple command-driven process that guides you from project idea to implementation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (2 minutes)

### **Step 1: Use This Template**

**Create your project repository on GitHub:**

1. **Use this template:**
   - Click the **"Use this template"** button at the top of this GitHub page
   - Choose **"Create a new repository"**
   - Select your GitHub account as the owner
   - Name your repository (this becomes your project name)
   - Choose public or private as needed
   - Click **"Create repository"**

2. **Clone YOUR new repository locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.git
   cd YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
   ```

3. **Open in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
4. **Save workspace for your project:**
   - In VS Code: File â†’ Save Workspace As...
   - Name it: `your-project-name.code-workspace` (e.g., `test2.code-workspace`)
   - Save it in your project root directory
   - When prompted, choose "Open Workspace"
  
5. **Import Claude Desktop MCP Servers:**
   - Do this on the terminal, NOT within Claude Code!
```bash
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
```

### **Step 2: Essential Setup**

**Open terminal in VS Code and run these commands:**

```bash
# Start Claude Code CLI (make sure you're in YOUR project directory)
claude

# Set up your project workspace (one-time only)
/project-setup

# Begin feature development 
/start-coding
```

**What `/project-setup` does for you:**
1. **Validates workspace safety** - Checks if setup was already completed to prevent double-execution
2. **Configures git remotes** - Adds template remote pointing to `ai-new-project-template` for inheriting updates
3. **Copies essential workflow files** - Moves `.ai-rules/` and `.project-docs/` from scaffolding to your project root (`.claude/` already available for immediate use)
4. **Creates project documentation** - Transforms template files into your project's `README.md` and `TODO.md`
5. **Sets up source directory** - Creates `src/` folder for your application code
6. **Cleans up scaffolding** - Removes `_project-scaffolding/` directory (contents now in proper locations)
7. **Commits setup changes** - Creates a clean git commit documenting the workspace transformation
8. **Enables template inheritance** - Shows you can now get template improvements with `git pull template main`

**âœ… Benefits of Template Approach:**
- **Clean GitHub workflow** - Purpose-built for template usage
- **Template inheritance** - Get improvements via template remote
- **Independent repository** - Your project owns its own git history
- **Professional setup** - GitHub's recommended template pattern

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete User Journey

```
1. Use template on GitHub â†’ your-username/your-project-name
2. Clone YOUR repository â†’ local development
3. cd your-project-name (CRITICAL!)
4. /project-setup (one-time workspace setup + template remote)
5. Setup Chat AI Strategist (recommended)
6. /start-coding (foundation â†’ PRD â†’ tasks â†’ implementation)
7. /start-coding (next feature: PRD â†’ tasks â†’ implementation)
8. /orient (anytime navigation)
```

### **What Each Command Does:**

- **`/project-setup`** - Transform template files, configure template remote, setup workspace
- **`/start-coding`** - Intelligent feature development orchestrator  
- **`/orient`** - Check current state and get guidance anytime

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### **3-Party Collaboration Model**
- **You:** Project director making decisions
- **Chat AI:** Strategic planning and context preparation
- **CLI AI:** Technical implementation and file operations

### **5-Step Workflow (Automated)**
1. **Project Foundation** - AI interview creates project context
2. **Dynamic Context** - Automatic context loading for AI assistants  
3. **Feature Planning** - PRD creation with validation criteria
4. **Task Generation** - Detailed implementation breakdown
5. **Quality Implementation** - Code execution with progressive validation

## ðŸ“‚ Template Structure

After `/setup-project`, your workspace will look like:

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/                    # Claude Code configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .ai-rules/                  # AI workflow instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ .project-docs/              # Project planning documents
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                        # Your application source code
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                      # Feature PRDs and task lists
â”œâ”€â”€ setup-claude-chat-ai/       # Chat AI Strategist setup instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # Your project's README (this gets replaced)
â”œâ”€â”€ TODO.md                     # Development task tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ AI_CONTEXT.md              # AI assistant briefing
â””â”€â”€ WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md          # Complete workflow documentation
```

- Maintains project-wide context

**"I'm getting git errors or wrong directory issues"**
- Make sure you're in YOUR project directory: `pwd`

### **If You Get Stuck:**
1. Try `/orient` for current state and next steps
2. Check `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` for detailed explanations
3. Ensure you're in YOUR project directory: `pwd`
4. Verify git remotes: `git remote -v` (should show your repository + template)
