# Generate Implementation Tasks

Generate detailed implementation tasks breakdown from requirements and design specifications, creating granular, sequenced tasks with clear dependencies and traceability.

## Usage

Use this command to generate comprehensive task breakdowns that bridge the gap between high-level specifications and actionable implementation work.

```
@generate-tasks
```

## Command Behavior

This command will:

1. **Analyze Specifications**: Read requirements.md and design.md to understand scope
2. **Component Breakdown**: Create tasks for each component in the pipeline
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Establish clear prerequisite relationships
4. **Task Granularity**: Break down into implementable units (4-12 hours each)
5. **Testing Integration**: Include test considerations for each task
6. **Quality Gates**: Add validation and quality assurance steps

## What Gets Generated

### Task Structure
- **Epic Level**: Major feature areas (Foundation, Components, Integration, QA, Production)

## Implementation Process

### 1. Specification Analysis
```bash
# Read and analyze specification files
- docs/specifications/requirements.md

- docs/specifications/PRD.md (if available)
```

### 2. Component Extraction
```bash
# Extract component information
- Component definitions and purposes
- Input/output specifications
- Interface requirements
- Quality standards
```

### 3. Task Generation
```bash
# Generate task hierarchy
- Epic-level planning
- Task breakdown with dependencies
- Subtask granular planning
- Testing and validation tasks
```

### 4. Validation and Optimization
```bash
# Validate and optimize task plan
- Dependency cycle detection
- Timeline feasibility analysis
- Resource allocation review
- Risk mitigation planning
```

## Example Output Structure

# Implementation Tasks Breakdown

## Epic 1: Project Foundation & Setup
### Task 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup ðŸŸ¡
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours  
**Dependencies**: None  

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project directory structure matches design specification
- [ ] Development environment functional
- [ ] Initial CI/CD pipeline operational

#### Subtasks
- [ ] 1.1.1: Create directory structure
- [ ] 1.1.2: Initialize package management
- [ ] 1.1.3: Configure development tools

### Task 1.2: Configuration System ðŸŸ¡
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1
[... detailed task specification]
```

## Configuration Options

### Task Granularity
- **Coarse**: Fewer, larger tasks (8-16 hours each)
- **Fine**: More, smaller tasks (2-6 hours each)
- **Balanced**: Mixed granularity based on complexity (default)

### Timeline Constraints
- **Aggressive**: Parallel work, tight timelines
- **Conservative**: Sequential dependencies, buffer time
- **Realistic**: Balanced approach with contingencies (default)

### Team Size Considerations
- **Solo Developer**: Single-threaded task planning
- **Small Team**: 2-4 developers with role specialization
- **Larger Team**: Parallel workstreams and coordination tasks

## Quality Assurance

### Task Validation
- All tasks link back to requirements
- Dependencies form valid DAG (no cycles)
- Effort estimates are reasonable
- Success criteria are measurable

### Reference Test Integration
