- **Others** (generic structure, manual setup required)

## ü§ñ AI Features

### Q: What are these @commands I keep seeing?
**A:** These are AI workflow commands powered by Claude Code:
- `@orient` - Get project overview and next steps
- `@next-task` - Select and plan your next component
- `@finalize-task` - Complete work with validation
- `@update-prd` - Sync project progress

### Q: Do I need API keys for AI features?
**A:** Depends on your setup:
- **Claude Code extension**: Uses your Anthropic account/credits
- **Basic template features**: No API keys needed
- **Gyro features**: Work with any AI assistant, no keys required

### Q: What happens if I don't have Claude Code extension?
**A:** The template still works! You get:
- ‚úÖ Complete project structure
- ‚úÖ Component-based development approach
- ‚úÖ Testing and validation frameworks
- ‚ùå AI workflow commands (@orient, @next-task, etc.)

## üèóÔ∏è Gyro Features

### Q: What are "Gyro features" and do I need them?
**A:** Gyro features are enhanced AI development capabilities:
- **Spec-driven development**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks workflow
- **Agent steering**: Persistent AI context through `.claude/steering/` files
- **Automated hooks**: Quality gates and validation triggers
- **Enhanced validation**: Comprehensive project health checks

**Recommendation**: Enable for production projects, skip for quick prototypes.

### Q: What's the difference between basic template and Gyro features?
| Feature | Basic Template | With Gyro Features |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Project structure | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Component workflow | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| AI commands | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Enhanced |
| Spec-driven development | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| AI steering system | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Automated validation | Basic | ‚úÖ Comprehensive |
| Production readiness | Manual | ‚úÖ Automated |

### Q: Can I add Gyro features to an existing project?
**A:** Yes! Run the initialization script in your existing project:
```bash
./scripts/initialize-project.sh
# Choose "y" for Gyro features when prompted
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Development

### Q: What's a "component-based pipeline"?
**A:** It's an approach where your project is built as a sequence of independent components:
```
Input ‚Üí Component 1 ‚Üí Component 2 ‚Üí Component 3 ‚Üí Output
```
Each component:
- Does one job well (Simple)
- Provides clear feedback (Lovable)
- Produces ready output (Complete)

### Q: How many components should my project have?
**A:** **4-8 components** is the sweet spot:
- **Fewer than 4**: Might be too simple for the template overhead
- **4-6 components**: Perfect for most projects
- **6-8 components**: Good for complex systems
- **More than 8**: Consider breaking into multiple projects

### Q: What if my project doesn't fit the pipeline model?
**A:** The template is flexible:
- **Web apps**: Authentication ‚Üí Routes ‚Üí Business Logic ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Frontend
- **APIs**: Input Validation ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Data Access ‚Üí Response Formatting
- **Data tools**: Ingestion ‚Üí Cleaning ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Visualization ‚Üí Export
- **Other**: Adapt the component concept to your domain

## üß™ Testing & Quality

### Q: Do I have to write tests?
**A:** The template **strongly encourages** testing but doesn't force it:
- Test framework is configured and ready
- Validation scripts check for tests
- AI commands include testing reminders
- **But**: You can skip tests for prototypes

### Q: What testing frameworks are used?
**A:** Language-specific standards:
- **Python**: pytest + coverage
- **JavaScript**: Jest + coverage
- **Go**: go test + coverage
- **Others**: Configure in `config/test-config.json`

### Q: What's this validation system about?
**A:** Multi-layer quality assurance:
1. **Specification validation**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks consistency
2. **Code quality**: Linting, formatting, standards
3. **Testing validation**: Coverage, test quality
4. **Production readiness**: Security, performance, deployment

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Q: Can I modify the directory structure?
**A:** Yes, but some paths are expected by the tooling:
- **Flexible**: `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` layout
- **Fixed**: `.claude/` structure for AI features
- **Configurable**: Most paths in `config/project-config.json`

### Q: What are all these .claude/ files?
**A:** AI coordination system:
```
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/           # AI workflow commands (@orient, @next-task)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ steering/          # Persistent AI context (Gyro feature)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/             # Automated quality gates (Gyro feature)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ execution-modes/   # AI behavior settings (Gyro feature)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json      # Claude Code configuration
```

### Q: Should I commit .claude/ to git?
**A:** **Yes!** These files are part of your development workflow:
- **Do commit**: Commands, steering files, hooks, configs
- **Don't commit**: API keys, personal settings, temporary files

## üöÄ Deployment & Production

### Q: How do I deploy projects built with this template?
**A:** The template prepares you for deployment but doesn't deploy:
- **Production readiness validation**: `@production-readiness` command
- **CI/CD integration**: JUnit XML, coverage reports ready
- **Docker support**: Add Dockerfile to your project
- **Platform agnostic**: Deploy to any platform

### Q: Is this suitable for production applications?
**A:** **Absolutely!** The template emphasizes production readiness:
- Comprehensive testing frameworks
- Security validation
- Performance monitoring
- Documentation standards
- Quality gates and validation

## üîß Customization

### Q: Can I use this with my existing tools?
**A:** Yes! The template integrates with:
- **IDEs**: VS Code (primary), others work
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
- **Testing**: Your existing test runners
- **Deployment**: Any platform or service

### Q: How do I customize the AI behavior?
**A:** Multiple customization points:
1. **Steering files**: Edit `.claude/steering/` for project context
2. **Execution modes**: Configure AI autonomy level
3. **Hooks**: Customize automation triggers
4. **Commands**: Modify `.claude/commands/` behavior

### Q: Can I remove AI features entirely?
**A:** Yes! You get a solid development template:
- Delete `.claude/` directory
- Use standard testing/validation tools
- Keep the component-based architecture
- Manual development workflow

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Q: The setup script fails, what do I do?
**A:** See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions. Common fixes:
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/initialize-project.sh

# Run with bash
bash scripts/initialize-project.sh

# Check Python version
python3 --version  # Need 3.8+
```

### Q: AI commands don't work, help!
**A:** Check these in order:
1. **Claude Code extension installed** in VS Code
2. **VS Code restarted** after extension install
3. **Command files exist**: `ls .claude/commands/`
4. **Try manual command**: Press Ctrl+Shift+P, type "@orient"

### Q: Validation fails with errors, what now?
**A:** Run diagnostics:
```bash
# Basic setup validation
python scripts/validate-setup.py

# Comprehensive validation (if Gyro enabled)
python scripts/validation/run-all-validations.py . --verbose
```

## üí° Best Practices

### Q: What's the recommended development workflow?
**A:**
1. **Plan**: `@orient` to see next steps
2. **Implement**: `@next-task` for guided development
3. **Validate**: `@finalize-task` with testing
4. **Track**: `@update-prd` for progress
5. **Repeat**: Continue cycle

### Q: How often should I run validation?
**A:**
