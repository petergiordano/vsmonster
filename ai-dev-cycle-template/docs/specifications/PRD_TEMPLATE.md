## Customization Instructions

### Required Customizations

1. **[PROJECT NAME]**: Replace with your actual project name
2. **[DATE]**: Replace with current date
3. **Vision Section**: Define what your system does and what manual work it eliminates
4. **Business Goals**: Set specific, measurable objectives for your project
5. **Component Pipeline**: Define 4-8 components that make up your processing pipeline
6. **Component Details**: For each component, specify:
   - Clear purpose and functionality
   - Specific input requirements
   - Expected output format
   - Measurable success criteria
7. **Technical Stack**: List your programming language, tools, and dependencies
8. **Success Metrics**: Define quantifiable targets for time, cost, quality, and automation
9. **Validation Standards**: Identify your reference test case or validation approach

### Component Design Guidelines

Each component should follow SLC principles:
- **Simple**: Does one job exceptionally well
- **Lovable**: Provides clear feedback and confidence to users
- **Complete**: Produces output ready for the next component without manual intervention

### Pipeline Flow Design

Ensure your components form a logical chain:
1. Component 1 ‚Üí Component 2 ‚Üí Component 3 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Component N
2. Each component's output becomes the next component's input
3. No manual intervention required between components
4. Each component can be developed and tested independently

---

**Bottom Line**: Build the simplest possible version of each component first. Each step should deliver immediate, testable value that compounds with previous work. No fancy interfaces‚Äîjust rock-solid functionality that gets you closer to automated [your process] production with every iteration.
