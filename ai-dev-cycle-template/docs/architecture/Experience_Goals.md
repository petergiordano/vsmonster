# Experience Goals & Design Vibe

**Version**: 2.0  
**Template Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-19

This document defines the **emotional and experiential goals** for your project. It answers the question: "How should this application make the user feel?"

## Core Design Philosophy

Our design is guided by three core documents. It is crucial to understand all three to make effective design decisions:

1. **[SLC Principles](./SLC_Principles.md)**: Defines **how** we approach building features (our process).
2. **This Document**: Defines **why** we are building and how users should feel (our emotional target).
3. **[Component Library & Design System](./ComponentLibrary.md)**: Defines the **what**‚Äîthe specific visual and structural components to use (our toolkit).

## Core Vibe Statement
*The fundamental emotional experience the application should create.*

**Primary Vibe**: "[CUSTOMIZE: Define your core user emotional experience]" - Users should feel [primary emotion] about [core value proposition] while being completely confident the system will deliver without breaking.

*Example: "Excitement through reliable automation" - Users should feel thrilled about the creative possibilities while being completely confident the system will deliver without breaking.*

## Emotional Journey Mapping
*How users should feel at each key interaction point.*

### üöÄ **Starting Your Process**
- **Target Emotion**: **[CUSTOMIZE: Primary start emotion]**
- **Feeling**: "[CUSTOMIZE: What users should think/feel when starting]"
- **Vibe Drivers**: 
  - [CUSTOMIZE: What creates this feeling]
  - Simple command initiation builds confidence
  - Clear project overview shows scope and timeline

### ‚ö° **During Processing**
- **Target Emotion**: **Confidence & Trust**
- **Feeling**: "The system is working perfectly - I can see exactly what's happening and trust it won't break"
- **Vibe Drivers**:
  - ASCII progress bars show real-time component status
  - Clear, informative status messages at each step
  - Fault-tolerant design with resume capability
  - No mysterious black-box processing

### üé¨ **Reviewing Final Output**
- **Target Emotion**: **[CUSTOMIZE: Completion emotion]**
- **Feeling**: "[CUSTOMIZE: How users should feel about results]"
- **Vibe Drivers**:
  - High-quality, professional output that exceeds expectations
  - [CUSTOMIZE: Domain-specific success indicators]
  - Ready-to-use format removes friction
  - [CUSTOMIZE: Next-step anticipation]

## Vibe Killers
*What would completely ruin the intended experience.*

### üí• **Critical Vibe Killers (Must Avoid)**
- **Mysterious Failures**: System breaks without clear explanation or recovery path
- **Black Box Processing**: Long periods with no status updates or unclear progress
- **Manual Intervention Required**: Having to manually fix files or restart processes
- **Unpredictable Costs**: Surprise charges without warning or estimation (if applicable)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Vibe Killers (Should Minimize)**
- **Slow Progress**: Taking longer than expected without clear time estimates
- **Generic Output**: Repetitive or low-quality results
- **Complex Setup**: Requiring technical knowledge to run basic operations
- **File Management Chaos**: Difficult to find or organize generated assets

## Success Emotions & Moments
*Specific emotional targets for key achievements.*

### üéØ **[CUSTOMIZE: Primary Success Scenario]**
- **Primary Emotion**: **[CUSTOMIZE: Success emotion]**
- **Secondary Emotions**: [CUSTOMIZE: Additional positive feelings]
- **Success Moment**: "[CUSTOMIZE: What users should think when successful]"

### üîÑ **Batch Processing Success** (if applicable)
- **Primary Emotion**: **Satisfaction & Relief**
- **Secondary Emotions**: Accomplishment, strategic confidence
- **Success Moment**: "[CUSTOMIZE: Batch completion feeling]"

### üìà **System Reliability Success**
- **Primary Emotion**: **Trust & Confidence**
- **Secondary Emotions**: Gratitude for automation, excitement for scaling
- **Success Moment**: "This system just works - I can depend on it completely!"

## Design Implications
*How the vibe requirements translate to system design decisions.*

### **Interface Design**
- **Command-Line Simplicity**: Clean, minimal commands that feel powerful (for both human users and AI agents, often invoked via `.claude/commands/*.md` files)
- **Status Communication**: Rich ASCII progress indicators and informative messages
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages with suggested fixes
- **Recovery Options**: Always provide "what to do next" guidance

### **Processing Design**
- **Transparency**: User always knows what component is running and why
- **Checkpoint System**: Can resume from any failed component
- **Quality Indicators**: Show confidence levels for processing results
- **Time Estimation**: Provide realistic completion time estimates

### **Output Design**
- **Professional Quality**: Output must meet your domain's quality standards
- **[CUSTOMIZE: Domain Elements]**: Leverage appropriate tools for unique, valuable content
- **Easy Access**: Generated files organized and easily accessible
- **Preview Capability**: Quick preview before full processing

## Inspiration References
*Applications and experiences that capture the target vibe.*

### **Similar Vibes We Want**
- **GitHub Actions**: Reliable automation with clear status and failure recovery
- **Modern CLI Tools**: (like `fd`, `ripgrep`) - Simple, fast, clear output
- **[CUSTOMIZE: Domain-specific positive examples]**
- **[CUSTOMIZE: Tools users already love in your space]**

### **Vibes We Want to Avoid**
- **Complex Enterprise Software**: Overwhelming interfaces with hidden failures
- **Legacy Command Tools**: Cryptic output and mysterious error messages
- **Unreliable Services**: Unpredictable failures without clear recovery
- **[CUSTOMIZE: Domain-specific negative examples]**

## Vibe Testing Protocol
*How to validate that the intended vibe is being achieved.*

### **Testing Questions**
1. When starting: "[CUSTOMIZE: Start confidence question]"
2. During processing: "Do I trust the system is working correctly?"
3. After completion: "[CUSTOMIZE: Success satisfaction question]"
4. After failure: "Do I understand what went wrong and how to fix it?"

### **Success Metrics**
- **Time to Confidence**: How quickly users trust the system won't break
- **[CUSTOMIZE: Domain Success Metric]**: How often results exceed expectations
- **Recovery Speed**: How quickly users can resolve issues and continue
- **[CUSTOMIZE: Usage Eagerness]**: How excited users are about the results
